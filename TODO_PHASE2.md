# Phase 2: Advanced Features Implementation - TODO List

## Overview
Phase 2 focuses on implementing advanced features including sentiment analysis, candlestick pattern recognition, multi-asset analysis, and enhanced evaluation metrics.

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Sentiment Analysis Integration
- [ ] Install required NLP libraries (transformers, nltk, vaderSentiment)
- [ ] Create news sentiment analysis module
- [ ] Implement social media sentiment scraping (Twitter, Reddit)
- [ ] Add sentiment features to existing feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Create sentiment-based trading signals

### 2. Advanced Candlestick Pattern Recognition
- [ ] Implement computer vision-based pattern detection
- [ ] Add traditional candlestick patterns (Doji, Hammer, Engulfing)
- [ ] Create pattern confidence scoring system
- [ ] Integrate pattern features into LSTM model
- [ ] Add pattern-based trading strategies

### 3. Multi-Asset Portfolio Optimization
- [ ] Create correlation analysis module
- [ ] Implement portfolio optimization algorithms
- [ ] Add cross-asset analysis features
- [ ] Create sector rotation strategies
- [ ] Implement risk parity allocation

### 4. Enhanced Evaluation & Risk Management
- [ ] Implement walk-forward analysis improvements
- [ ] Add transaction cost modeling
- [ ] Create regime-specific performance metrics
- [ ] Implement position sizing algorithms
- [ ] Add risk-adjusted performance tracking

### 5. Advanced Data Sources
- [ ] Add options flow analysis
- [ ] Implement dark pool data integration
- [ ] Create unusual options activity detection
- [ ] Add economic calendar integration
- [ ] Implement earnings surprise analysis

### 6. Production Infrastructure
- [ ] Create model registry with MLflow
- [ ] Implement feature store with Redis
- [ ] Add model monitoring and alerting
- [ ] Create interactive dashboard with Streamlit
- [ ] Implement real-time alerts system

### 7. Documentation & Testing
- [ ] Create comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Add unit tests for new features
- [ ] Create integration tests
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Create deployment guide
