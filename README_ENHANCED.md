## Usage Examples

### 1. Dark Pool Analysis
```python
from src.dark_pool_integration import DarkPoolDataAnalyzer
analyzer = DarkPoolDataAnalyzer(api_key='your_api_key')
dark_pool_data = analyzer.analyze_dark_pool_activity('AAPL')
```

### 2. Economic Calendar
```python
from src.economic_calendar_integration import EconomicCalendarAnalyzer
analyzer = EconomicCalendarAnalyzer(api_key='your_api_key')
events = analyzer.get_economic_calendar('2024-01-01', '2024-01-31')
```

### 3. Options Flow
```python
from src.enhanced_options_flow import EnhancedOptionsFlowAnalyzer
analyzer = EnhancedOptionsFlowAnalyzer(api_key='your_api_key')
sentiment = analyzer.analyze_options_flow_sentiment('AAPL')
```

### 4. Advanced ML Models
```python
from src.advanced_ml_models import AdvancedModelTrainer
trainer = AdvancedModelTrainer()
model = trainer.train_transformer(X, y, epochs=100)
```

### 5. Real-time Streaming
```python
from src.real_time_streaming import KafkaStreamingService
service = KafkaStreamingService()
service.start_streaming(['AAPL', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT'])
```

## Installation and Setup

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements_enhanced.txt
```

2. Configure API keys:
```bash
export FINNHUB_API_KEY=your_api_key
